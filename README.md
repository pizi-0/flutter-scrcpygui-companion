> A companion app for my [Scrcpy GUI](https://github.com/pizi-0/flutter-scrcpygui), made purely to cater to my laziness to walk 2 feets to my table to start scrcpy. Probably not for most people.

## ✨ Key Features
* Execute Scrcpy GUI commands remotely, such as:
    * Start/stop scrcpy
    * Disconnect wireless devices

> Disclaimer: Scrcpy GUI Companion does not do Android to Android mirroring. That is out of scope.
